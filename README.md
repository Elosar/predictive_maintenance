# Predictive Maintenance & Alarm Intelligence for Railway Transport

This project builds a data-driven system for **predictive maintenance** and **anomaly detection** in railway transport, focusing on the **train’s traction system**. It enables:

- Early detection of abnormal alarm behavior
- Classification of **critical alarms**
- Forecasting of alarm volumes using time series analysis

It combines **machine learning**, **time series modeling**, and **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques, applied to Trenord telemetry and maintenance data.

## About the Project

The project explores the feasibility of applying a **data-driven strategy** within the decision-making process of **Trenord**, a regional railway operator in Northern Italy. It leverages historical alarm data, maintenance logs, and service information to build machine learning and time series models for early warning and classification systems.

## Dataset

The dataset was collected and pre-processed as part of a predictive maintenance initiative at the **University of Bologna** in collaboration with **Trenord** (Giulia Millitarì, 2023/2024). This project extends and adapts that work to build new tools. [Direct link to the mentioned work](https://iris.cnr.it/handle/20.500.14243/514952)


### 🔹 Dataset Files

| File              | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `TSR_040_DEF.csv` | Event-level alarm dataset with 101,708 rows × 19 columns. Contains timestamps, sources, alarm codes, GPS, wagon IDs, and labels like `Criticality`. |
| `TSR_040_daily.csv` | Daily aggregated dataset with 767 rows × 259 columns. Includes alert counts, maintenance/service data, and total km traveled. |

## Modules Overview

This project contains two main components:

### 🔹 1. Alarm Classification

Predict whether an individual alarm is **critical** or **non-critical** using an XGBoost model.  
Includes class rebalancing (SMOTETomek), categorical encoding, threshold analysis, and SHAP explanations.

📘 Detailed instructions: [classification/README.md](classification/README.md)

---

### 🔹 2. Time Series Forecasting

Forecast the **number of daily critical alarms** per train car using Prophet.  
Generates individual forecasts, heatmaps, and performance comparisons.

📘 Detailed instructions: [time_series/README.md](time_series/README.md)

## ▶️ Run the Project

### Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To run classificatio pipeline

cd classification
python criticality_classifier.py         # Trains and saves model, metrics, plots
python shap_explanations.py              # Optional: generates SHAP plots

To run Time Series Pipeline

cd timeseries
python timeseries_analysis.py

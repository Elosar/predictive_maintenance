# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for the initial exploration and analysis of the datasets used in the Trenord predictive maintenance project.

## Contents

- `trenord_data_EDA.ipynb`: Initial EDA on the main dataset. Includes:
  - Overview of dataset structure and features
  - Missing value analysis
  - Class balance and target variable distribution
  - Key feature distributions and statistics

## Purpose

The goal of these notebooks is to:

- Understand the structure and quality of the input data
- Identify potential issues (e.g., missing values, imbalanced classes)
- Extract initial insights that guide preprocessing and model design
- Potential modelling and heatmaps

## Notes

These notebooks are designed for internal exploration and discussion. Visuals and comments aim to ensure interpretability and traceability of decisions.
